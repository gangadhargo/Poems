          </p>
          <p>
            <span>As the rain gently subsides,</span>
            <span>The stars emerge from their hiding places in the plain sky,</span>
            <span>A celestial light show to brighten up the night.</span>
            <span>Amidst the Margosa trees, a cool breeze</span>
            <span>Brings relief to the whole terrace,</span>
            <span>Driving away mosquitoes and flies with its gentle touch.</span>
            <span>In the distance, people chant and pray to their gods, searching for something.</span>
            <span>An infant cries out, but his mother's soothing voice calms him down.</span>
            <span>Dogs barked in the night, and for a moment,</span>
            <span>It seemed like they might be trying to protect the village.</span>
            <span>Gradually, all sounds fade into silence as the whole village falls asleep.</span>

          <p>
            <span>At the airport, I met a beautiful young girl</span>
            <span>who was braiding her silky black hair</span>
            <span>so that it would not fall onto her shoulders.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>We talked about our pasts as we looked for our flights</span>
            <span>and had no idea what the future held.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Eventually, we left to catch our respective departures</span>
            <span>without saying goodbye.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>We never meet the present;</span>
            <span>life is all about exchanging stories from the past,</span>
            <span>never knowing what is in store,</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>while dying without learning what the present holds.</span>

          </p>
          <p>
            <span>A flock of sheep was crossing the road, causing the impatient humans on their bikes to blare their horns.</span>
            <span>The sheep were bleating in confusion and fear. Wasn't this violence? Many people did not recognise it as such.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>A young boy was playfully swatting a dog with a stick,</span>
            <span>leaving the animal running around in confusion as it didn't understand why he was being beaten. Again, wasn't this violence?</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>On the shore of a river, there was a temple where people chanted loudly to their god each evening, disturbing the calm waters.</span>
            <span>Wasn't this noise pollution a form of violence?</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Any activity done to escape oneself can be seen as an act of violence against the present moment - lo, we are easily ignorant.</span>

            <span>Slippery of thought</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>As one strolls along the road, green meadows stretch far and wide.</span>
            <span>Taking in the beautiful verdant scene in silence, a thought suddenly pops up that proves insignificant.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>The realisation of its own insignificance causes it to linger for some time.</span>
            <span>One gets lost in this thought, forgetting all about the present moment;</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>however, when understanding its lack of importance, the thought slowly vanishes.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>All of sudden one is aware that one among houses.</span>
            <span>It's remarkable how easy it is to divert focus away from the here and now onto an inconsequential thought.</span>

            <span>The winding road was surrounded by lush pastures,</span>
            <span>and the sun slowly sank lower in the sky as the village descended into darkness.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>A cool breeze rustled through the air,</span>
            <span>and the unmistakable sound of peacocks calling and frogs hopping off the pavement filled the air.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Everyone was rushing to get home for the night,</span>
            <span>while an old couple smiled at each other as they took a stroll.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Everything that had happened in this moment seemed to have been frozen in time,</span>
            <span>only to be remembered later when someone chose to write it down on paper.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>But could one ever capture a moment so perfectly with abstraction?</span>
            <span>The duality of life began here.</span>

            <span>At the beach, a sloshing sound signalled that it was starting to rain.</span>
            <span>The men embraced the waves and were overjoyed by the rain.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>The waves crashed against the shore before slipping away into their source.</span>
            <span>Tiny crabs scurried around their tiny holes on the shore while people hid under trees to keep from getting drenched.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>When the rain stopped suddenly, an eerie silence surrounded the trees.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>People started walking home while crabs resumed crawling along the sand.</span>

            <span>What causes this suddenness?</span>
            <span>Can one's brain ever truly answer it?</span>

          </p>
          <p>
            <span>One was sitting on a bench beside the road, lush green pastures spread out in both directions.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>The clouds started to move, blocking out the sun.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>A rush of air caused all things, living and dead, to stir.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Dead leaves began to fall from the trees and birds flew against the current.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>A bike passed by with a child clinging onto his father so he wouldnâ€™t fall off.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Tiny bugs moved around beneath the scattered foliage.</span>
            <span>Several perished, while people hurried to get out of the rain.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Dead things were supporting living things and living things were becoming dead things;</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>There was only one thing is experiencing itself.</span>
            <span>One's own personal experience is just a dead end.</span>
